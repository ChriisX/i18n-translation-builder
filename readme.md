# i18n translation builder

## What is it?

Sometimes it's already really long to build your entire page and you don't want to waste anymore time building your translation files.

Now, the only thing you have to do is call the i18n translation builder command with the path of your file and the path of your future translation files:

`i18n-build c:/.../pathToVueFile.php c:/.../pathToTranslateFile.php`

## "I want to use it! Can I?"

Well... no, or not yet actually! It's only a prototype and the command doesn't really exists, only the algorithm that turns the Vue file into a translation file. But it's coming asap!
